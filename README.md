**Oh, here is a joke I heard from my 10 year old son.**

On the first day of class, a teacher starts by saying, "Everyone who thinks they're stupid, stand up!"

After a moment of silence, little Johnny stood up. The teacher asks, "Why do you think you're stupid, Johnny?"

Little Johnny said, "I don't think I'm stupid, I just felt bad you're standing there all by yourself."

Lol!!!... Not sure if I'm retelling the joke correctly, but it was really funny when my son told it, though!
